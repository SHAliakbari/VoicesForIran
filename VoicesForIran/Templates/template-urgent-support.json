  "Subject": "Urgent: Your Constituent from {{PostalCode}} Asks You to Support Human Rights in Iran",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nI am writing to you as your constituent living in {{RidingName}} (postal code {{PostalCode}}) to express my deep concern about the ongoing human rights crisis in Iran.\n\nThe Iranian regime is waging war against its own people. Unarmed civilians - men, women, and children - are being shot with live ammunition in the streets. The regime has imposed brutal internet shutdowns to hide its atrocities from the world while it murders its own citizens. People with bare hands are standing against military forces armed with real war bullets. This is not a protest - it is a massacre.\n\nI urge you to:\n\n1. Publicly condemn the Iranian regime's use of lethal force against peaceful protesters\n2. Support targeted Magnitsky sanctions against officials responsible for these killings\n3. Demand the restoration of internet access so the world can witness these crimes\n4. Advocate for the release of thousands of political prisoners\n5. Support the Iranian people's right to determine their own future\n\nPrince Reza Pahlavi has emerged as a unifying voice for millions of Iranians seeking a free, secular, and democratic Iran. His vision of a peaceful transition to democracy, with full respect for human rights and the rule of law, represents the aspirations of the Iranian people. Canada should engage with and support this democratic movement.\n\nAs your constituent from {{PostalCode}}, I am counting on you to be a voice for the voiceless.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical matter."
