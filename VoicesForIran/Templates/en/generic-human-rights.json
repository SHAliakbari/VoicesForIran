  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nI am writing to you as your constituent living in {{RidingName}} (postal code {{PostalCode}}) to express my deep concern about the ongoing human rights crisis in Iran.\n\nThe Iranian regime is waging war against its own people. Unarmed civilians - men, women, and children - are being shot with live ammunition in the streets. The regime has imposed brutal internet shutdowns to hide its atrocities from the world while it murders its own citizens.\n\nI urge you to:\n\n1. Publicly condemn the Iranian regime's use of lethal force against peaceful protesters\n2. Support targeted Magnitsky sanctions against officials responsible for these killings\n3. Demand the restoration of internet access so the world can witness these crimes\n4. Advocate for the release of thousands of political prisoners\n5. Support the Iranian people's right to determine their own future\n\nAs your constituent from {{PostalCode}}, I am counting on you to be a voice for the voiceless.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical matter.\n\n{{UserName}}"
