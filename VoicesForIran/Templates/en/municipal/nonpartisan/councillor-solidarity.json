  "Body": "Dear Councillor {{RepresentativeName}},\n\nAs a resident of {{RidingName}} ({{PostalCode}}), I am reaching out about our local Iranian-Canadian community.\n\nThe Iranian regime is massacring its own people. Protesters are shot with live ammunition. Many of our neighbors have family affected by this violence.\n\nI am asking you to:\n\n1. Support a council resolution expressing solidarity with Iranian-Canadians\n2. Help connect community members with local support services\n3. Consider local events or proclamations recognizing the struggle\n4. Ensure newcomers from Iran can access municipal services\n\nOur community is stronger when we support all our members. Thank you for representing us.\n\n{{UserName}}"
