  "Body": "Dear Mayor {{RepresentativeName}},\n\nAs a resident of {{RidingName}} ({{PostalCode}}), I am writing about our local Iranian-Canadian community and the crisis affecting their homeland.\n\nMany of our neighbors have family in Iran who face violence and persecution. The Iranian regime is shooting peaceful protesters with live ammunition.\n\nOur city can show solidarity. I respectfully request that you consider:\n\n1. A public statement of support for our Iranian-Canadian community\n2. Proclamation of a day recognizing the Iranian people's struggle for freedom\n3. Flying the historic Lion and Sun flag at City Hall to show solidarity\n4. Supporting local organizations helping Iranian newcomers\n5. Meeting with community leaders to understand their concerns\n\nOur Iranian-Canadian residents are valued members of this community. A gesture of support from local leadership would mean a great deal.\n\nThank you for your service to our community.\n\n{{UserName}}"
