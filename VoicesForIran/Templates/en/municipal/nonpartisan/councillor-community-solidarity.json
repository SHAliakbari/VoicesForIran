  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing about our local Iranian-Canadian community and their connection to Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution. Many of our neighbors have family in Iran facing brutal repression-mass killings, torture, executions, and internet blackouts meant to hide crimes. The Islamic Republic is failing, but the violence continues. Our Iranian-Canadian neighbors are grieving and need our community's support.\n\nWhile foreign policy is federal jurisdiction, our municipality can show meaningful solidarity. I respectfully ask you to consider these local actions:\n\n1. Pass a council resolution expressing solidarity with the Iranian-Canadian community and condemning the Iranian regime's violence.\n2. Consider flying the historic Lion-and-Sun flag at municipal buildings to show support for Iran's democratic aspirations.\n3. Organize or support community events recognizing the Iranian people's struggle for freedom.\n4. Ensure municipal newcomer services are accessible and responsive to Iranian refugees and recent arrivals.\n5. Work with local Iranian-Canadian organizations to understand community needs and coordinate support.\n6. Issue a proclamation recognizing the contributions of Iranian-Canadians to our community.\n7. Add your voice to those calling on the federal government to take stronger action in support of the Iranian people.\n8. Ensure our community remains welcoming and safe for all, including those fleeing persecution.\n\nLocal solidarity matters. Our Iranian-Canadian neighbors need to know we stand with them.\n\nLong live freedom. Long live Iran. Victory to Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
