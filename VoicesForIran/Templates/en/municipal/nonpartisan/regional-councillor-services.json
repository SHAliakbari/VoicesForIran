  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing about regional support for our Iranian-Canadian community in connection with Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution. The Islamic Republic continues brutal repression-tens of thousands killed, widespread torture, executions, and internet blackouts. Many regional residents have family affected by this violence. While international policy is beyond regional government scope, we can provide meaningful local support.\n\nI respectfully request you consider these regional actions:\n\n1. Support a regional resolution expressing solidarity with the Iranian-Canadian community.\n2. Ensure regional services (settlement support, language training, credential recognition, mental health) are accessible to Iranian newcomers and refugees.\n3. Work with community organizations serving Iranian-Canadians to coordinate regional resources and support.\n4. Consider regional recognition of the Iranian community's contributions through proclamations or events.\n5. Ensure regional employment and social services are responsive to the specific needs of Iranian refugees and asylum seekers.\n6. Add regional government's voice to calls for stronger federal action in support of the Iranian people.\n7. Allocate resources for community organizations providing culturally appropriate services to Iranian-Canadians.\n8. Ensure our region remains welcoming and supportive for all, including those fleeing persecution.\n\nRegional government can make a real difference through practical support and solidarity.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue for our community and for Canada.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
