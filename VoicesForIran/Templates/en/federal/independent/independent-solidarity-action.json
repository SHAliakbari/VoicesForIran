  "Subject": "Stand with Iran’s Lion‑and‑Sun Revolution",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing to urge principled Canadian action in response to the Islamic Republic’s ongoing brutality — mass killings of tens of thousands, torture, executions, and deliberate internet blackouts used to hide its crimes. The regime’s failures are undeniable; the era of freedom is near, and Canada should stand with the Iranian people’s democratic aspirations.\n\nPlease use your voice in {{RidingOrRegion}} and within Parliament to press the Government of Canada to act. I respectfully request the following actions:\n\n1. Dismantle the regime’s machinery of repression and protect the people of Iran.\n2. Cut off the regime’s financial lifelines in full.\n3. Ensure free internet and communications access for the people of Iran.\n4. Expel the regime’s “diplomats” and prosecute its agents involved in criminal activity.\n5. Prepare to recognize a legitimate transitional government to lead Iran toward democracy.\n6. Publicly condemn the massacres and the IRGC’s role in repression, and enforce the removal of senior IRGC members reported to be in Canada.\n7. Seize regime‑linked assets for humanitarian relief and democratic opposition support, and formally invite Prince Reza Pahlavi to address Parliament.\n\nThank you for your leadership and for taking a clear, principled stand.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue for our community and for Canada.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
