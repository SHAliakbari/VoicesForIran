  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nAs your constituent from {{RidingName}} ({{PostalCode}}), I am writing to urge action on the human rights crisis in Iran.\n\nThe Iranian regime is massacring its own people. Peaceful protesters are shot with live ammunition. The regime shuts down the internet to hide its crimes. Thousands have been killed; many more imprisoned and tortured.\n\nI urge you to:\n\n1. Publicly condemn the regime's violence against civilians\n2. Support targeted sanctions against officials responsible for abuses\n3. Advocate for the release of political prisoners\n4. Support Iranian refugees fleeing persecution\n5. Work across party lines to ensure a strong Canadian response\n\nThis is not a partisan issue. Human rights transcend politics. I am counting on you to speak out.\n\nThank you for your service to our community.\n\n{{UserName}}"
