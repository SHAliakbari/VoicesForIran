  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nI am writing as your constituent from {{RidingName}} ({{PostalCode}}) to urge immediate action on refugee support for Iranians fleeing persecution.\n\nThe Iranian regime is massacring its people. Those who escape face an uncertain future. Many are stranded in third countries, waiting for Canada to offer sanctuary. We can do more.\n\nI am asking you to:\n\n1. Advocate for expanded refugee pathways specifically for Iranians\n2. Push for faster processing of Iranian refugee applications\n3. Support community sponsorship programs\n4. Ensure refugees have access to settlement services and mental health support\n5. Speak out against any deportations to Iran\n\nCanada has a proud tradition of welcoming those fleeing persecution. The Iranian people need us now.\n\nThe regime shoots protesters with real war bullets. It shuts down the internet to murder in darkness. Those who escape deserve our help.\n\nWith hope,\n{{UserName}}"
