  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing in solidarity with Iran’s Lion‑and‑Sun Revolution — a people’s uprising led by workers, students, women, ethnic minorities, and ordinary citizens fighting for freedom and dignity. The Islamic Republic has massacred tens of thousands, including teachers, nurses, oil workers, and bus drivers who dared to strike or protest. This regime wages war against its own working class. The era of freedom is near.\n\nThe NDP has always stood with workers and the oppressed. I ask you to stand with the Iranian people by supporting the following actions:\n\n1. Speak out strongly in solidarity with Iranian workers, unions, and grassroots movements fighting for their rights.\n2. Push for targeted Magnitsky sanctions against regime officials responsible for suppressing labour rights and murdering workers.\n3. Ensure Canadian sanctions target regime elites, not ordinary Iranians who are already suffering under dictatorship.\n4. Expand refugee pathways specifically for persecuted Iranian workers, unionists, teachers, and activists.\n5. Demand the immediate release of all political prisoners, especially imprisoned labour leaders and workers.\n6. Advocate for free internet access for Iran — workers and organizers rely on it to communicate and document abuses.\n7. Ensure Canadian companies are not complicit in regime abuses by demanding strict corporate accountability.\n8. Support grassroots Iranian civil‑society organizations, especially worker‑led and community‑based groups.\n\nThis is a workers’ revolution. The NDP must stand on the right side of history.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue for our community and for Canada.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
