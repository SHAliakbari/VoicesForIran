  "Subject": "People's Uprising: Support Iranian Grassroots Movement",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nIran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution is a grassroots people's movement. Workers, students, women, ethnic minorities, and ordinary citizens are rising up against a brutal dictatorship. The Islamic Republic responds with mass killings, torture, executions, and internet blackouts. This is the struggle of the many against the powerful few. The regime is failing; the people are winning.\n\nThe NDP stands for social justice and people power. I ask you to support these actions:\n\n1. Publicly express solidarity with the Iranian people's grassroots movement for freedom and justice.\n2. Advocate for sanctions that target regime elites, not ordinary Iranians already suffering under dictatorship.\n3. Push for the immediate release of all political prisoners-workers, students, activists, and ordinary people imprisoned for demanding freedom.\n4. Champion free internet access for Iran-the regime uses blackouts to isolate and terrorize the population.\n5. Support Iranian civil society organizations, especially grassroots, worker-led, and community-based groups.\n6. Demand accountability for regime crimes through international justice mechanisms.\n7. Ensure Canada prioritizes human rights and people's welfare over economic interests with regard to Iran.\n8. Welcome and support Iranians fleeing persecution with compassionate refugee policies.\n\nThe Iranian people are fighting for the same values the NDP champions: justice, equality, and freedom.\n\nLong live freedom. Long live Iran. Victory to Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
