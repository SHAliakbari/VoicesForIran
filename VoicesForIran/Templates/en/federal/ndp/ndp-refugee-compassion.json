  "Subject": "Urgent: Expand Refugee Support for Iranians - {{PostalCode}}",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nIran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution has put thousands of Iranians at risk. The Islamic Republic massacres protesters, tortures activists, executes dissidents, and imprisons anyone who speaks out. Those who escape face an uncertain future, often stranded in third countries waiting for sanctuary. Canada can-and must-do more.\n\nThe NDP has a proud history of welcoming refugees. I urge you to champion these urgent refugee measures:\n\n1. Advocate for expanded and expedited refugee pathways specifically for Iranians fleeing persecution.\n2. Push for fast-track processing of Iranian refugee applications-people are in danger now.\n3. Support increased funding for community sponsorship programs to help Iranian-Canadians sponsor family members.\n4. Ensure refugees have access to trauma-informed mental health services and settlement support.\n5. Speak out against any deportations to Iran-no one should be sent back to face torture or execution.\n6. Push for special measures for at-risk groups: women, LGBTQ+ individuals, ethnic minorities, and activists.\n7. Ensure Canadian visa offices in the region have resources to process Iranian cases quickly.\n8. Support non-governmental organizations providing aid to Iranian refugees in third countries.\n\nIranians fleeing the regime deserve our help. Canada must act with compassion and urgency.\n\nLong live freedom. Long live Iran. Victory to Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
