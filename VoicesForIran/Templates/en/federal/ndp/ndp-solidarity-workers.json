  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nAs your constituent from {{RidingName}} ({{PostalCode}}), I am writing to express solidarity with the workers and people of Iran.\n\nThe Iranian regime is waging war against its own working class. Teachers, nurses, oil workers, and bus drivers have joined the protests and faced brutal repression. Union leaders are arrested. Workers are shot for striking. This is an attack on labor rights that should concern us all.\n\nAs someone who believes in workers' rights and social justice, I urge you to:\n\n1. Speak out in solidarity with Iranian workers and unions\n2. Support Magnitsky sanctions against regime officials suppressing labor rights\n3. Advocate for expanded refugee pathways for persecuted Iranians\n4. Push for corporate accountability - ensure Canadian companies aren't complicit in regime abuses\n5. Support grassroots organizations helping Iranians\n\nThe regime is shooting protesters with live ammunition. People with bare hands face military force. Canada must stand on the right side of history.\n\nIn solidarity,\n{{UserName}}"
