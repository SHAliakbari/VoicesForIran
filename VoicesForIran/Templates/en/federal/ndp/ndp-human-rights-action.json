  "Subject": "{{PostalCode}} Constituent: Demand Human Rights Action on Iran",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nAs a resident of {{RidingName}} ({{PostalCode}}), I am writing to demand meaningful action on human rights in Iran.\n\nThe situation is dire. The regime is executing protesters. Young people are shot in the streets for demanding freedom. Women are killed for refusing to cover their hair. The regime imposes internet blackouts to hide its atrocities from the world.\n\nThis is not acceptable. I urge you to:\n\n1. Push for strong, coordinated sanctions against regime leaders\n2. Support international investigation into crimes against humanity\n3. Advocate for the release of all political prisoners\n4. Demand internet access as a basic human right\n5. Ensure Canada's response prioritizes people over politics\n\nThe NDP has always stood for human rights and justice. I am counting on you to lead on this issue.\n\n{{UserName}}"
