  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing about a direct national security threat to Canada. The Islamic Republic's reign of terror extends beyond Iran's borders. The IRGC - a designated terrorist organization - operates on Canadian soil, intimidating Iranian-Canadians and threatening our security. This regime has killed tens of thousands in Iran, including 55 Canadians on Flight PS752. Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution shows the regime is failing, but it remains dangerous.\n\nAs a Conservative, you understand that protecting Canadians is the first duty of government. I urge you to champion these security-focused measures:\n\n1. Conduct a full security review of IRGC presence in Canada - identify and remove all senior members immediately.\n2. Expand sanctions to cut off all regime financial networks operating in or through Canada.\n3. Investigate and prosecute regime agents engaged in transnational repression against Iranian-Canadians.\n4. Seize all regime-linked assets in Canada - use them for victim compensation and humanitarian aid.\n5. Strengthen protection for Iranian-Canadians facing intimidation, surveillance, and threats.\n6. Support secure internet access for Iran - the regime uses blackouts to hide crimes and prevent organizing.\n7. Push for international recognition of a legitimate transitional government to replace this terrorist regime.\n8. Invite Prince Reza Pahlavi to address Parliament - show Canada backs Iran's democratic future, not its terrorist government.\n\nThis is about protecting Canadian lives and sovereignty. The regime that killed 55 Canadians operates with impunity in our country. That must end.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue for our community and for Canada.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
