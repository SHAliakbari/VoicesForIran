  "Subject": "Strong Stance Needed: Support Iran’s Revolution",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nIran’s Lion‑and‑Sun Revolution is gaining momentum as the Iranian people fight for the same freedoms we enjoy in Canada. The Islamic Republic responds with mass killings, torture, executions, and deliberate internet blackouts to hide its crimes. Iranian‑Canadian families in our community are watching in fear and grief. This regime is not only a human‑rights abuser — it is a direct security threat. The IRGC killed 55 Canadians on Flight PS752 and continues to operate on Canadian soil with impunity. The regime is failing, but Canada’s response has been weak.\n\nAs a Conservative, you know that strength and moral clarity matter. Canada must take a strong stance:\n\n1. Fully enforce the IRGC terrorist designation — no tolerance for senior IRGC members remaining in Canada.\n2. Expand sanctions aggressively to cut off every financial lifeline to the regime.\n3. Seize regime‑linked assets in Canada and use them for victim compensation and democratic opposition support.\n4. Expel all regime “diplomats,” who act as spies and agents of intimidation.\n5. Support free and open internet access for Iran — the regime hides behind blackouts to commit crimes.\n6. Push for international recognition of a legitimate transitional government for Iran.\n7. Formally invite Prince Reza Pahlavi to address Parliament, signaling Canada’s support for a democratic Iran.\n\nIranians are fighting for freedom. Canada must stand with them decisively.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue for our community and for Canada.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
