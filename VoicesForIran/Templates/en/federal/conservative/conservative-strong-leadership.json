  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\\n\\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\\n\\nIran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution is gaining momentum - the people are fighting for the freedom we enjoy in Canada. But the Islamic Republic responds with mass killings, torture, executions, and internet blackouts. Canadian families with ties to Iran are watching in horror. This regime is not just a human rights violator - it's a security threat. The IRGC killed 55 Canadians on Flight PS752 and operates on our soil with impunity. The regime is failing, but Canada's response has been weak.\\n\\nAs a Conservative, you know that strength and moral clarity matter. Canada needs to take a strong stance:\\n\\n1. Fully enforce IRGC terrorist designation - no more tolerance for senior IRGC members in Canada.\\n2. Expand sanctions aggressively - cut off every financial lifeline to this murderous regime.\\n3. Seize regime assets in Canada and use them for victim compensation and opposition support.\\n4. Expel all regime \\\"diplomats\\\" - they are spies and agents of intimidation.\\n5. Support free internet for Iran - the regime hides behind blackouts to commit crimes.\\n6. Push for international recognition of a legitimate transitional government for Iran.\\n7. Formally invite Prince Reza Pahlavi to address Parliament - signal Canada's support for a democratic Iran.\\n\\nIranians are fighting for freedom. Canada must stand with them decisively.\\n\\nLong live freedom. Long live Iran. Victory to Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n{{UserName}}"
