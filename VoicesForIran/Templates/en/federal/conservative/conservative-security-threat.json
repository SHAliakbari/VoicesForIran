  "Subject": "{{PostalCode}} Constituent: IRGC Threat and Canada's Security Response",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nAs your constituent from {{RidingName}} ({{PostalCode}}), I am writing about the serious security threat posed by the Iranian regime and the IRGC to Canada and Canadians.\n\nThe Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is a designated terrorist organization that threatens not only Iranians but also Canadians on our own soil. Iranian-Canadians face harassment and intimidation from regime agents. This is unacceptable.\n\nAs a Conservative voice in Parliament, I urge you to:\n\n1. Advocate for stronger enforcement of IRGC terrorist designation\n2. Push for targeted Magnitsky sanctions against regime officials responsible for human rights abuses\n3. Support measures to protect Iranian-Canadians from regime harassment\n4. Demand accountability for the regime's shooting down of Flight PS752, which killed 55 Canadians\n5. Call for expulsion of regime agents operating in Canada\n\nThe Iranian regime murders its own citizens with impunity. Unarmed protesters are shot with live ammunition while the regime shuts down the internet to hide its crimes. Canada must stand firm against this brutality.\n\nAs a constituent who votes, I am watching how our representatives respond to these threats. I count on you to prioritize Canadian security and human rights.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
