  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nAs a resident of {{RidingName}} ({{PostalCode}}), I am writing to express my frustration with Canada's weak response to the Iranian regime's atrocities.\n\nWhile the regime guns down peaceful protesters - shooting them with live ammunition, shutting down the internet to hide the carnage, and imprisoning thousands - Canada's response has been inadequate. We need strong leadership.\n\nI urge you to push for:\n\n1. A comprehensive review of all diplomatic and economic ties with Iran\n2. Stronger enforcement of existing sanctions\n3. Support for Iranian pro-democracy movements\n4. Protection for Iranian-Canadians from regime intimidation\n5. A clear, consistent message that Canada will not tolerate human rights abuses\n\nThe Iranian people are fighting for the same values we cherish: freedom, democracy, and human rights. They deserve Canada's full support, not tepid statements.\n\nAs my representative in Parliament, I am counting on you to be a voice for strength and principle.\n\n{{UserName}}"
