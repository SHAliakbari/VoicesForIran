  "Subject": "PS752 & IRGC Threat: Canada Must Act",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing about a direct threat to Canadian security and values. The Islamic Republic is a violent authoritarian regime, and the IRGC — a listed terrorist organization — is reported to have operatives in Canada who intimidate Iranian‑Canadians and undermine our safety. This is the same regime responsible for murdering protesters, torturing dissidents, imposing internet blackouts to hide atrocities, and killing 55 Canadians and 85 other passengers aboard Flight PS752. The regime is failing, but it remains dangerous.\n\nConservatives understand that weakness emboldens dictators. I urge you to use your voice in {{RidingOrRegion}} and push the government to take decisive action:\n\n1. Enforce the IRGC terrorist designation and remove all senior IRGC members from Canada immediately.\n2. Expand Magnitsky sanctions to target every regime official involved in repression, torture, and killings.\n3. Expel regime “diplomats” who spy on and intimidate Iranian‑Canadians.\n4. Hold the government accountable for weak enforcement — demand action, not just words.\n5. Strengthen protections for Iranian‑Canadians facing harassment and intimidation on Canadian soil.\n6. Support efforts to recognize a legitimate transitional government for Iran.\n7. Invite Prince Reza Pahlavi to address Parliament to demonstrate Canada’s commitment to a free and democratic Iran.\n\nThis is about protecting Canadians and upholding our values.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue for our community and for Canada.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
