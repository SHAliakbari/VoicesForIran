  "Subject": "PS752 & IRGC Threat: Canada Must Act - {{PostalCode}} Constituent",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing about a direct threat to Canadian security and values. The Islamic Republic is a terrorist regime - the IRGC, designated as a terrorist organization, has operatives in Canada intimidating Iranian-Canadians. This regime murders protesters (tens of thousands killed), tortures dissidents, and uses internet blackouts to hide atrocities. It also threatens Canada directly - remember Flight PS752, where 55 Canadians and 85 other passengers were killed by the IRGC. The regime is failing, but it remains dangerous.\n\nConservatives understand that weakness emboldens dictators. I urge you to use your voice in {{RidingOrRegion}} and push the government to take decisive action:\n\n1. Enforce the IRGC terrorist designation - remove all senior IRGC members from Canada immediately.\n2. Expand Magnitsky sanctions to target every regime official involved in repression, torture, and killings.\n3. Expel regime \\\"diplomats\\\" who spy on and intimidate Iranian-Canadians.\n4. Hold the government accountable for weak enforcement - demand action, not just words.\n5. Protect Iranian-Canadians from regime harassment and intimidation on Canadian soil.\n6. Support efforts to recognize a legitimate transitional government for Iran.\n8. Invite Prince Reza Pahlavi to address Parliament - demonstrate Canada's commitment to a free Iran.\n\nThis is about protecting Canadians and upholding our values.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue for our community and for Canada.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
