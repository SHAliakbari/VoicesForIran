  "Subject": "Action Required: Sanctions Against Iranian Regime Officials - {{PostalCode}}",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nI am a constituent from {{RidingName}} (postal code {{PostalCode}}) urging immediate action on sanctions against Iranian regime officials.\n\nThe regime in Tehran is massacring its own people. Citizens armed with nothing but bare hands face security forces with real war bullets. Young Iranians are shot in the head and chest simply for demanding freedom. The regime imposes internet blackouts to murder in darkness.\n\nThis is not governance - it is terrorism against a population.\n\nI am calling on you to:\n\n1. Champion comprehensive Magnitsky sanctions against all officials involved in ordering or executing violence against protesters\n2. Support asset seizure of regime officials' holdings in Canada\n3. Push for travel bans against regime collaborators\n4. Advocate for investigating regime money laundering through Canadian financial institutions\n5. Hold the government accountable for weak responses to regime brutality\n\nCanada must not be a safe haven for those who profit from Iranian suffering. As a Conservative, you understand the importance of holding rogue regimes accountable.\n\nI live at {{PostalCode}}. I vote. I am watching.\n\nRespectfully,\n{{UserName}}"
