  "Subject": "Security Threat: Act Against Iranian Regime — IRGC in Canada",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing in solidarity with Iran’s Lion‑and‑Sun Revolution and the Iranian people’s fight for freedom against a brutal theocratic dictatorship. The Islamic Republic has killed tens of thousands, tortured peaceful protesters, executed dissidents, and imposed internet blackouts to hide its crimes. This regime threatens not only Iranians but also Canadian security — the IRGC is a listed terrorist organization with operatives reported to be present in Canada. The regime is failing; the era of freedom is near.\n\nAs a Conservative, you understand the need for strong, principled action against rogue regimes. I respectfully ask you to champion the following urgent measures:\n\n1. Push for maximum sanctions to cut off the regime’s financial lifelines completely.\n2. Demand full enforcement of the IRGC terrorist designation — remove senior IRGC members (with ~700 reported in Canada) immediately.\n3. Seize all regime‑linked assets in Canada and redirect them to humanitarian relief and Iran’s democratic opposition.\n4. Expel regime “diplomats” and ensure prosecution of regime criminals under universal jurisdiction.\n5. Support free and open internet access for Iran — the regime uses blackouts to murder in darkness.\n6. Call for the immediate release of all political prisoners, including dual Canadian‑Iranian citizens.\n7. Advocate for recognizing a legitimate transitional government to replace the Islamic Republic.\n8. Invite Prince Reza Pahlavi to address Parliament — demonstrating Canada’s commitment to Iran’s democratic future.\n\nCanada must not be a safe haven for those who profit from Iranian blood.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue for our community and for Canada.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
