  "Subject": "Support Democracy in Iran: Canada Must Lead - {{PostalCode}}",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\\n\\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\\n\\nI am writing about Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution - a democratic uprising against a brutal theocratic dictatorship. The Islamic Republic has massacred tens of thousands, tortured protesters, executed dissidents, and imposed internet blackouts to hide crimes. Iranians are fighting for the same democratic values Canada champions: freedom, human rights, rule of law, and secular government. The regime is failing; the era of freedom is near.\\n\\nConservatives understand that democracies must support democratic movements worldwide. I respectfully ask you to champion these measures:\\n\\n1. Publicly recognize and support Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution as a legitimate democratic movement.\\n2. Impose maximum economic pressure - expand sanctions to completely isolate the regime financially.\\n3. Ensure IRGC terrorist designation is fully enforced - no senior IRGC members should remain in Canada.\\n4. Seize all regime assets in Canada and redirect them to support Iran's democratic opposition and humanitarian relief.\\n5. Champion free internet for Iran - democratic movements need communication to organize and document abuses.\\n6. Demand the immediate release of all political prisoners, including dual Canadian-Iranian citizens.\\n7. Prepare Canada to recognize a legitimate transitional government when the regime falls.\\n8. Formally invite Prince Reza Pahlavi to address Parliament - demonstrate Canada's commitment to a free, democratic Iran.\\n\\nDemocracy doesn't just happen - it needs support from established democracies. Iranians are risking their lives for freedom. Canada must stand with them decisively.\\n\\nLong live freedom. Long live Iran. Victory to Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n{{UserName}}"
