  "Subject": "Support Democracy in Iran: Canada Must Lead",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing about Iran’s Lion‑and‑Sun Revolution — a democratic uprising against a brutal theocratic dictatorship. The Islamic Republic has massacred tens of thousands, tortured protesters, executed dissidents, and imposed internet blackouts to hide its crimes. Iranians are fighting for the same democratic values Canada champions: freedom, human rights, the rule of law, and secular governance. The regime is failing; the era of freedom is near.\n\nConservatives understand that democracies must support democratic movements worldwide. I respectfully ask you to champion the following measures:\n\n1. Publicly recognize and support Iran’s Lion‑and‑Sun Revolution as a legitimate democratic movement.\n2. Impose maximum economic pressure by expanding sanctions to fully isolate the regime financially.\n3. Ensure the IRGC terrorist designation is fully enforced — no senior IRGC members should remain in Canada.\n4. Seize all regime‑linked assets in Canada and redirect them to support Iran’s democratic opposition and humanitarian relief.\n5. Champion free and open internet access for Iran — democratic movements rely on communication to organize and document abuses.\n6. Demand the immediate release of all political prisoners, including dual Canadian‑Iranian citizens.\n7. Prepare Canada to recognize a legitimate transitional government when the regime falls.\n8. Formally invite Prince Reza Pahlavi to address Parliament, demonstrating Canada’s commitment to a free and democratic Iran.\n\nDemocracy does not flourish on its own — it requires support from established democracies. Iranians are risking their lives for freedom. Canada must stand with them decisively.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue for our community and for Canada.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
