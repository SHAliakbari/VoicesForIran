  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nI am writing as your constituent from {{RidingName}} ({{PostalCode}}) to urge solidarity with Iran's grassroots movement for freedom.\n\nWhat is happening in Iran is a people's uprising. Ordinary citizens - students, workers, women, minorities - are standing up against a violent regime. They have no weapons but their voices and their courage. The regime responds with bullets.\n\nThis movement connects to struggles worldwide. I urge you to:\n\n1. Express solidarity with Iranian civil society\n2. Support international mechanisms to protect activists\n3. Push for sanctions that target regime leaders, not ordinary Iranians\n4. Advocate for humanitarian support for movement participants\n5. Ensure Canada's policies support, not undermine, grassroots movements\n\nThe Iranian people are showing us what courage looks like. Canada should stand with them.\n\nIn hope,\n{{UserName}}"
