  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nAs your constituent from {{RidingName}} ({{PostalCode}}), I am writing about the fundamental right to peaceful protest - a right being brutally denied to Iranians.\n\nThe Iranian regime responds to peaceful protesters with live ammunition. People exercising their basic human rights are shot, arrested, tortured, and executed. The regime shuts down the internet to suppress information and kill in secrecy.\n\nThe right to protest is sacred. It is how ordinary people create change. I urge you to:\n\n1. Speak out forcefully for the right to peaceful assembly in Iran\n2. Condemn the regime's use of lethal force against protesters\n3. Support sanctions against officials responsible for suppressing protests\n4. Advocate for internet freedom as a human right\n5. Stand in solidarity with Iranian environmental and social activists\n\nClimate activists, women's rights advocates, labor organizers - all are persecuted in Iran. Their fight is connected to movements worldwide.\n\nCanada must defend the right to protest everywhere.\n\n{{UserName}}"
