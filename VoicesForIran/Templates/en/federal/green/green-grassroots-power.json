  "Subject": "Grassroots Democracy: Support Iranian Civil Society",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nIran’s Lion‑and‑Sun Revolution is a grassroots uprising led by ordinary people — students, workers, women, environmental activists, and minorities — demanding democracy and freedom. The Islamic Republic responds with live ammunition, torture, executions, and deliberate internet blackouts that isolate communities and hide its crimes. This is people‑powered democracy confronting authoritarian violence, and the regime is failing.\n\nGreens understand the power of grassroots movements. I ask you to support the following measures:\n\n1. Express clear solidarity with Iranian grassroots civil society and people‑led movements.\n2. Ensure sanctions target regime elites, not ordinary Iranians or civil society organizations.\n3. Champion free internet and communications access for Iran — grassroots movements depend on digital organizing.\n4. Support funding and resources for Iranian civil society organizations, especially women‑led and youth‑led groups.\n5. Advocate for environmental and social‑justice activists through refugee protection and international mechanisms.\n6. Demand the release of all political prisoners, including climate activists and community organizers.\n7. Push for international accountability mechanisms that center community voices and grassroots documentation.\n8. Ensure Canadian policy supports — rather than undermines — people‑led movements in Iran, and formally invite Prince Reza Pahlavi to address Parliament.\n\nGrassroots movements change the world. Canada must support them.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue for our community and for Canada.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
