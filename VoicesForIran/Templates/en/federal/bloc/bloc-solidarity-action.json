  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am writing as a constituent in {{RidingOrRegion}}, residing in {{PostalCode}}, to urge principled Canadian action in response to the Islamic Republic’s ongoing brutality. The regime continues to commit mass killings, torture, executions, and widespread internet blackouts to conceal its crimes. Its failures are undeniable. The Iranian people are demanding freedom, and Canada should stand firmly with their democratic aspirations.\n\nI respectfully ask that you use your voice in {{RidingOrRegion}} to press the Government of Canada to take meaningful action. Specifically, I urge you to support the following measures:\n\n1. Dismantle the regime’s machinery of repression and protect the people of Iran.\n2. Cut off the regime’s financial lifelines in full.\n3. Ensure free and open internet access for the people of Iran.\n4. Expel the regime’s diplomats and prosecute its agents involved in criminal activity.\n5. Demand the immediate release of all political prisoners.\n6. Prepare to recognize a legitimate transitional government committed to leading Iran toward democracy.\n7. Publicly condemn the massacres and the IRGC’s role in repression, and enforce the removal of senior IRGC members reported to be in Canada.\n8. Seize regime‑linked assets to support humanitarian relief and democratic opposition efforts, and formally invite Prince Reza Pahlavi to address Parliament.\n\nThank you for your leadership and for taking a principled stand on this critical issue for our community and for Canada.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
