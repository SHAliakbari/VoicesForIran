  "Subject": "From {{PostalCode}}: Stand with Iran-s Lion-and-Sun Revolution",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing to urge principled Canadian action in response to the Islamic Republic-s ongoing brutality-mass killings of tens of thousands, torture, executions, and internet blackouts to hide crimes. The regime-s failures are undeniable; the era of freedom is near, and Canada should stand with the Iranian people-s democratic aspirations.\n\nPlease use your voice in {{RidingOrRegion}} and within your caucus to press the Government of Canada to act. I respectfully request these actions:\n\n1. Dismantle the regime-s machinery of repression and protect the people of Iran.\n2. Cut off the regime-s financial lifelines in full.\n3. Ensure free internet and communications for the people of Iran.\n4. Expel the regime-s -diplomats- and prosecute its criminals.\n5. Immediate release of all political prisoners.\n6. Prepare to recognize a legitimate transitional government to lead Iran toward democracy.\n7. Publicly condemn the massacres and the IRGC-s role in repression, and enforce removals of senior IRGC members reported to be in Canada.\n8. Seize regime-linked assets for humanitarian relief and democratic opposition support, and formally invite Prince Reza Pahlavi to address Parliament.\n\nThank you for your leadership and for taking a clear, principled stand.\n\nLong live freedom. Long live Iran. Victory to Iran-s Lion-and-Sun Revolution.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
