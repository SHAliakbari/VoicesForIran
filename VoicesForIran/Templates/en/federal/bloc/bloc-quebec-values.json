  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nAs your constituent from {{RidingName}} ({{PostalCode}}), I am writing about the human rights catastrophe in Iran.\n\nThe Iranian regime is killing its own people. Citizens demanding freedom, equality, and dignity are shot with live ammunition. Women are murdered for demanding control over their own bodies. The regime imposes theocratic rule through violence.\n\nQuebec has always valued secularism, individual freedom, and human rights. The Iranian people are fighting for these same values. I urge you to:\n\n1. Condemn the regime's violence against peaceful protesters\n2. Support targeted sanctions against regime officials\n3. Advocate for refugees fleeing religious persecution\n4. Speak out for women's rights and secular governance\n5. Ensure Canada's response reflects our commitment to human dignity\n\nThe people of Iran deserve to live freely, without religious tyranny. Canada must support their struggle.\n\nRespectueusement,\n{{UserName}}"
