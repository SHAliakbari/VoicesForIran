  "Subject": "Constituent Request from {{PostalCode}}: Diplomatic Action on Iran",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nAs a constituent from {{RidingName}} (postal code {{PostalCode}}), I am writing to urge coordinated diplomatic action on Iran.\n\nThe Iranian regime continues to massacre its own people. Protesters armed with nothing but their voices face security forces with live ammunition. The regime shuts down the internet to hide its crimes. Thousands have been killed; tens of thousands imprisoned.\n\nCanada cannot address this alone, but we can lead. I ask that you:\n\n1. Work with allies to coordinate a strong, unified response\n2. Support international mechanisms to document regime crimes\n3. Advocate for an independent UN investigation into human rights violations\n4. Push for the EU and other partners to strengthen sanctions\n5. Ensure Canada's diplomatic efforts prioritize human rights over trade\n\nCanada's voice matters in the international community. Please use it to speak for those who cannot speak freely.\n\nThank you for your service to our community.\n\n{{UserName}}"
