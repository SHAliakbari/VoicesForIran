  "Subject": "Canadian Values: Stand with Iranian-Canadians and Iran's Revolution",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing about how Canada can demonstrate our values by supporting Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution and the Iranian-Canadian community. The Islamic Republic continues brutal repression - mass killings of tens of thousands, torture, executions, and internet blackouts to hide crimes. Many Canadian families have loved ones directly affected by this violence. Canada's strength lies in our diversity and our commitment to human rights for all. The regime is failing; the era of freedom is near.\n\nI respectfully ask you to champion these principled actions that reflect Canadian values:\n\n1. Engage meaningfully with Iranian-Canadian communities - listen to their experiences and amplify their voices.\n2. Lead international efforts to expand coordinated sanctions targeting regime leadership and financial networks.\n3. Champion internet freedom for Iran - coordinate with allies to provide tools and infrastructure for free communication.\n4. Prioritize Iranian refugees and asylum seekers - expedite processing and ensure comprehensive settlement support.\n5. Support the immediate release of all political prisoners, including dual Canadian-Iranian citizens unjustly detained.\n6. Work with allies to document regime crimes and pursue accountability through international justice mechanisms.\n7. Prepare to recognize a legitimate transitional government that can lead Iran toward democracy.\n8. Ensure Canada's response centers the voices and aspirations of the Iranian people themselves.\n\nCanadian values - human rights, democracy, diversity, and compassion - must guide our response. Iranian-Canadians are watching. The world is watching.\n\nLong live freedom. Long live Iran. Victory to Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
