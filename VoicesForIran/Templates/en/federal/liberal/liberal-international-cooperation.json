  "Subject": "International Coordination: Lead on Iran",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing about Iran’s Lion‑and‑Sun Revolution and Canada’s role in the international response. The Islamic Republic has massacred tens of thousands, carried out torture and executions, and repeatedly used internet blackouts to hide its crimes. This regime threatens regional and global security. The era of freedom for Iran is near, and Canada can help ensure it arrives with justice rather than impunity.\n\nAs a Liberal, you understand the power of international cooperation and diplomacy. I ask you to lead on the following coordinated actions:\n\n1. Work with allies — including the G7, EU, and NATO partners — to implement comprehensive, coordinated sanctions that isolate the regime economically.\n2. Champion a coordinated international effort to ensure free internet access for Iran, partnering with tech companies and democratic nations to provide secure tools.\n3. Lead at the UN to establish an independent investigation into crimes against humanity committed by the Islamic Republic.\n4. Coordinate with allies to expel regime diplomats and intelligence operatives from democratic nations.\n5. Work internationally to freeze and seize regime‑linked assets, redirecting funds to humanitarian relief and democratic civil society.\n6. Advocate for international recognition of a legitimate transitional government when appropriate.\n7. Ensure Canada prioritizes human rights over economic interests in all dealings related to Iran.\n8. Engage meaningfully with Iranian‑Canadian communities to inform Canada’s diplomatic approach.\n\nCanada’s voice matters on the world stage. Use it to lead.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue for our community and for Canada.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
