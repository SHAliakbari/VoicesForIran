  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nI am writing as your constituent from {{RidingName}} ({{PostalCode}}) about the women-led revolution in Iran and Canada's feminist foreign policy.\n\nThe \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" movement began when Mahsa Amini was killed by morality police for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly. Since then, brave Iranian women have led protests demanding freedom and dignity - and the regime has responded with bullets.\n\nWomen are being shot, arrested, tortured, and executed. Young girls are being killed for their courage. This is a feminist crisis of global proportions.\n\nCanada's feminist foreign policy must mean something. I urge you to:\n\n1. Centre women's voices in Canada's response to the Iran crisis\n2. Support women human rights defenders fleeing Iran\n3. Advocate for release of imprisoned women activists\n4. Push for sanctions against officials responsible for violence against women\n5. Ensure Canada's statements explicitly recognize the feminist nature of this revolution\n\nThe women of Iran are fighting for all of us. Canada must stand with them.\n\nIn solidarity,\n{{UserName}}"
