  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing in solidarity with Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution and the Iranian people's fight for freedom, democracy, and human rights. The Islamic Republic continues brutal repression - mass killings of tens of thousands, torture, executions, and repeated internet blackouts. Women, students, and workers are leading this movement. The regime is failing; the era of freedom is near.\n\nCanada has long championed human rights globally. I ask you to demonstrate leadership by supporting these urgent actions:\n\n1. Work with international partners to expand coordinated sanctions against regime leadership and cut off financial support.\n2. Champion internet freedom for Iran - coordinate with allies to provide tools and infrastructure for free communication.\n3. Lead efforts at the UN and with allied nations to document regime crimes and pursue accountability through international mechanisms.\n4. Expand refugee pathways for Iranians fleeing persecution - prioritize women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and activists.\n5. Support the immediate release of all political prisoners, including dual Canadian-Iranian citizens unjustly detained.\n6. Engage with Iranian-Canadian communities to understand their needs and amplify their voices.\n7. Consider recognizing a legitimate transitional government when the time comes to support Iran's path to democracy.\n8. Ensure Canada's response reflects our foreign policy - center the voices of Iranian leading this revolution.\n\nCanada must lead with principle and action.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue for our community and for Canada.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
