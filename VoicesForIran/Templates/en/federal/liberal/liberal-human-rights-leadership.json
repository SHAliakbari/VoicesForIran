  "Subject": "{{PostalCode}} Constituent: Canada's Human Rights Leadership on Iran",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nAs your constituent from {{RidingName}} ({{PostalCode}}), I am writing to urge Canada to demonstrate the human rights leadership our country is known for.\n\nThe situation in Iran is a humanitarian catastrophe. The regime is shooting unarmed civilians with live ammunition. Protesters with bare hands face military forces with war bullets. Internet blackouts are imposed to hide the killings from the world.\n\nCanada has always stood for human rights on the world stage. I am asking you to:\n\n1. Publicly condemn the Iranian regime's systematic violence against protesters\n2. Support targeted sanctions under Canada's Magnitsky legislation\n3. Work with international partners to coordinate pressure on the regime\n4. Ensure Canada remains a safe haven for Iranian refugees fleeing persecution\n5. Engage with Iranian-Canadian communities to understand their concerns\n\nCanada's commitment to human rights must be more than words. The Iranian people are watching. The world is watching.\n\nAs a constituent who shares Canada's values of freedom and dignity, I am counting on you to lead.\n\nWith respect,\n{{UserName}}"
