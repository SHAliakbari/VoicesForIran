  "Subject": "Refugee Protection: Support Iranians Fleeing Persecution",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing about Canada's response to Iranians fleeing persecution from the Islamic Republic. Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution has put thousands at risk - the regime has killed tens of thousands, tortured activists, executed dissenters, and imprisoned families. Those who escape face an uncertain future. Many are stranded in third countries, waiting for Canada to offer sanctuary. We can and must do more.\n\nCanada has a proud tradition of welcoming refugees. I urge you to champion these compassionate measures:\n\n1. Create expedited refugee pathways specifically for Iranians fleeing the regime's persecution.\n2. Prioritize family reunification - many Iranian-Canadians have relatives in immediate danger.\n3. Fast-track processing for at-risk groups: women, LGBTQ+ individuals, ethnic minorities, journalists, and activists.\n4. Increase refugee admission targets for Iranians and allocate resources to process applications quickly.\n5. Ensure settlement services, mental health support, and integration programs are available and culturally appropriate.\n6. Support community sponsorship programs enabling Iranian-Canadians to sponsor family members.\n7. Work internationally to protect Iranian refugees in third countries while they await resettlement.\n8. Ensure no deportations to Iran - sending anyone back means torture or execution.\n\nThese are people fleeing for their lives from a regime that tortures and kills. Canada's humanitarian values demand we act with urgency and compassion.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue for our community and for Canada.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
