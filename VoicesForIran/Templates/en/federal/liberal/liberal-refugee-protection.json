  "Subject": "Refugee Protection: Support Iranians Fleeing Persecution",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing about Canada’s response to Iranians fleeing persecution by the Islamic Republic. Iran’s Lion‑and‑Sun Revolution has placed thousands at grave risk — the regime has killed tens of thousands, tortured activists, executed dissenters, and imprisoned entire families. Those who manage to escape face an uncertain and often dangerous future. Many are stranded in third countries, waiting for Canada to offer sanctuary. We can and must do more.\n\nCanada has a proud tradition of welcoming refugees. I urge you to champion the following compassionate measures:\n\n1. Create expedited refugee pathways specifically for Iranians fleeing the regime’s persecution.\n2. Prioritize family reunification — many Iranian‑Canadians have relatives in immediate danger.\n3. Fast‑track processing for at‑risk groups, including women, LGBTQ+ individuals, ethnic minorities, journalists, and activists.\n4. Increase refugee admission targets for Iranians and allocate resources to process applications quickly.\n5. Ensure settlement services, mental‑health support, and integration programs are available and culturally appropriate.\n6. Support community‑sponsorship programs enabling Iranian‑Canadians to sponsor family members.\n7. Work internationally to protect Iranian refugees stranded in third countries while they await resettlement.\n8. Ensure no deportations to Iran — returning anyone to the regime risks torture or execution.\n\nThese are people fleeing for their lives from a regime that tortures and kills. Canada’s humanitarian values demand that we act with urgency and compassion.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue for our community and for Canada.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
