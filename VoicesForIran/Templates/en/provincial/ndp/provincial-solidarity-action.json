  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing about how our province can show solidarity with Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution and support our Iranian-Canadian community. The Islamic Republic's brutal repression-tens of thousands killed, torture, executions, internet blackouts-affects many provincial residents with family in Iran. Our province can demonstrate meaningful support.\n\nI respectfully request you support these provincial actions:\n\n1. Introduce and pass a provincial legislative resolution condemning the Iranian regime and supporting the Iranian-Canadian community.\n2. Enhance settlement services, mental health supports, and integration programs for Iranian newcomers.\n3. Work with Iranian-Canadian community organizations to ensure provincial programs meet community needs.\n4. Use your provincial platform to call on the federal government to strengthen sanctions and expand refugee acceptance.\n5. Expedite professional credential recognition to help Iranian professionals contribute their skills.\n6. Ensure provincial education and employment programs are accessible to Iranian refugees and newcomers.\n7. Consider a provincial day or week recognizing Iranian-Canadian Heritage and the community's contributions.\n8. Allocate resources for culturally competent services supporting trauma survivors and those with family affected by violence.\n\nProvincial solidarity demonstrates shared values and provides practical support to those in need.\n\nLong live freedom. Long live Iran. Victory to Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
