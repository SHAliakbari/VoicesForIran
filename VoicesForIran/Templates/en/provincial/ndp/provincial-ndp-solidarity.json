  "Subject": "{{PostalCode}}: Provincial Solidarity with Iranian People",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nAs your constituent from {{RidingName}} ({{PostalCode}}), I am writing to urge provincial solidarity with the people of Iran.\n\nWorkers, students, women, and ordinary citizens in Iran are rising up against a violent regime. They are met with bullets. The regime shoots protesters with live ammunition and shuts down the internet to kill in darkness.\n\nOur province should stand in solidarity. I urge you to:\n\n1. Pass a provincial resolution condemning the regime's violence\n2. Support community organizations helping Iranian newcomers\n3. Ensure provincial services are accessible to refugees\n4. Recognize Iranian-Canadian Heritage and contributions to our province\n5. Work with federal counterparts to coordinate support\n\nThe struggle for workers' rights, women's rights, and human dignity in Iran connects to our values here.\n\nIn solidarity,\n{{UserName}}"
