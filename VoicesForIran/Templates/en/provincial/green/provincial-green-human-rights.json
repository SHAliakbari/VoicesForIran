  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nAs your constituent from {{RidingName}} ({{PostalCode}}), I am writing about how our province can support human rights for Iranians.\n\nThe Iranian regime is massacring peaceful protesters. People exercising their basic rights are shot, arrested, and tortured. Those who escape come to Canada seeking safety.\n\nOur province can help. I urge you to:\n\n1. Support newcomer services for Iranian refugees\n2. Ensure provincial programs are trauma-informed\n3. Recognize the Iranian community's contributions\n4. Pass resolutions condemning human rights abuses\n5. Model the democratic values Iranians are dying for\n\nHuman rights are universal. Supporting them starts locally.\n\n{{UserName}}"
