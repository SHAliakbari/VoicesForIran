  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing about Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution and how our province can support the Iranian-Canadian community. The Islamic Republic has massacred tens of thousands, committed widespread torture and executions, and imposed internet blackouts. Many in our province have family directly affected. While international policy is federal, our province can take meaningful action.\n\nI respectfully request you champion these provincial measures:\n\n1. Pass a provincial resolution condemning the Iranian regime's violence and expressing solidarity with the Iranian-Canadian community.\n2. Enhance provincial settlement and integration services specifically for Iranian refugees and newcomers.\n3. Allocate provincial resources for trauma-informed mental health services for those affected by regime violence.\n4. Expedite credential recognition processes for Iranian professionals (doctors, engineers, teachers) fleeing persecution.\n5. Support community organizations serving Iranian-Canadians with provincial funding and resources.\n6. Use your provincial platform to call on the federal government to take stronger action.\n7. Ensure provincial programs and services are culturally responsive to Iranian-Canadian needs.\n8. Consider a provincial proclamation recognizing Iranian-Canadian Heritage and the community's contributions.\n\nProvincial action demonstrates solidarity and provides real support to community members in need.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue for our community and for Canada.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
