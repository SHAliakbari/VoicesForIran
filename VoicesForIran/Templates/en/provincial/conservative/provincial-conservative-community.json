  "Subject": "{{PostalCode}} Constituent: Support for Iranian-Canadian Community",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nAs your constituent from {{RidingName}} ({{PostalCode}}), I am writing about the Iranian-Canadian community in our province and the crisis affecting their homeland.\n\nMany Iranian-Canadians in our community have family members still in Iran who face violence and persecution. The regime shoots protesters with live ammunition and shuts down internet access to hide its crimes.\n\nWhile foreign policy is a federal matter, our province can help. I urge you to:\n\n1. Express provincial solidarity with Iranian-Canadians\n2. Support community organizations helping new arrivals from Iran\n3. Ensure provincial services are accessible to Iranian refugees\n4. Consider provincial recognition of the Iranian people's struggle\n5. Work with the federal government to coordinate support\n\nIranian-Canadians are valued members of our community. They need to know their province stands with them.\n\nThank you,\n{{UserName}}"
