  "Subject": "Welcome Iranian Refugees: Provincial Action Needed",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing about provincial support for Iranian refugees fleeing the Islamic Republic's brutal repression. Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution has put thousands at risk-the regime has killed tens of thousands, committed torture and executions, and imprisoned dissenters. Those who escape need our province's compassion and support.\n\nI respectfully request you champion these provincial refugee support measures:\n\n1. Expand provincial settlement services and funding for organizations supporting Iranian refugee resettlement.\n2. Ensure fast-tracked access to provincial health care, including trauma-informed mental health services.\n3. Expedite credential recognition for Iranian professionals to help them rebuild their lives and contribute their skills.\n4. Provide enhanced language training programs accessible to Iranian newcomers.\n5. Allocate resources for community-based organizations with cultural competency to serve Iranian refugees.\n6. Create provincial pathways or nominee programs that can prioritize at-risk Iranians when possible.\n7. Ensure provincial social services are accessible and responsive to Iranian refugees' specific needs.\n8. Call on the federal government to expand refugee acceptance and expedite processing.\n\nOur province has a proud tradition of welcoming those fleeing persecution. Iranian refugees need that compassion now.\n\nLong live freedom. Long live Iran. Victory to Iran's Lion-and-Sun Revolution.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
