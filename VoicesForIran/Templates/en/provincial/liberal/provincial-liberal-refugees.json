  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nAs your constituent from {{RidingName}} ({{PostalCode}}), I am writing about provincial support for Iranian refugees.\n\nThousands of Iranians are fleeing persecution. The regime in Tehran shoots peaceful protesters with live ammunition and imprisons those who survive. Those who escape need our help.\n\nOur province can make a difference. I urge you to:\n\n1. Advocate for enhanced settlement services for Iranian refugees\n2. Support mental health services for trauma survivors\n3. Ensure language training and credential recognition programs are accessible\n4. Work with community organizations serving Iranian newcomers\n5. Consider provincial nominee programs that prioritize at-risk Iranians\n\nThese are people fleeing for their lives. Our province should welcome them.\n\nWith gratitude,\n{{UserName}}"
