  "Subject": "A Plea from Your Constituent ({{PostalCode}}): Stop the Massacre in Iran",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nAs a proud constituent of {{RidingName}}, writing from postal code {{PostalCode}}, I am compelled to bring to your attention the ongoing massacre in Iran.\n\nEvery day, the Iranian regime murders its own people. Unarmed civilians with bare hands face military forces wielding real war bullets. Young men and women are shot in the head and chest for simply demanding freedom. The regime imposes total internet shutdowns - not to restore order, but to kill in darkness, away from the eyes of the world. When they restore the internet, the blood has been washed away, but the bodies remain.\n\nThis is genocide in slow motion.\n\nI am asking you to take concrete action:\n\n- Speak publicly and forcefully against the regime's murder of civilians\n- Demand immediate restoration of internet access in Iran\n- Advocate for targeted Magnitsky sanctions against regime killers\n- Support humanitarian assistance for victims and their families\n- Engage with the Iranian diaspora in crafting Canada's response\n\nPrince Reza Pahlavi stands as a symbol of hope for the Iranian people. He advocates for a secular, democratic Iran where all ethnicities and religions live as equals. His call for peaceful transition, national reconciliation, and human rights has united Iranians worldwide. Canada should stand with him and the Iranian people's democratic aspirations.\n\nI live at {{PostalCode}} in your riding. I am watching. I am voting. Please act.\n\nThank you for representing our community and our values."
