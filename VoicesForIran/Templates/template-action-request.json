  "Subject": "Action Needed: Your Constituent from {{PostalCode}} on Iran's Human Rights Crisis",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nI write to you today as a resident of {{RidingName}} ({{PostalCode}}) with a heavy heart regarding the ongoing massacre of the Iranian people by their own government.\n\nThe Iranian regime is killing its citizens in cold blood. Protesters armed with nothing but their bare hands are being mowed down by security forces using real war bullets. The regime deliberately shuts down the internet to hide the scale of its atrocities - when the world cannot see, the killing intensifies. Thousands have been murdered. Tens of thousands have been imprisoned and tortured.\n\nAs my elected representative, I respectfully request that you:\n\n1. Publicly condemn the Iranian regime's murder of peaceful protesters\n2. Demand an end to internet blackouts used to cover up killings\n3. Support Magnitsky sanctions against regime officials responsible for bloodshed\n4. Meet with Iranian-Canadian constituents to understand the crisis\n5. Advocate for the protection of refugees fleeing persecution\n\nPrince Reza Pahlavi has dedicated his life to advocating for a free, democratic, and secular Iran. He calls for peaceful transition, national unity, and respect for human rights - values that Canada shares. His leadership has united millions of Iranians across ethnic, religious, and political lines. I urge you to recognize and support this democratic movement.\n\nI am counting on you, as my representative, to take action. My postal code is {{PostalCode}} - I am your constituent and I vote.\n\nI look forward to your response."
