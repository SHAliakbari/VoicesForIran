  "Subject": "From {{PostalCode}}: Stand with the Iranian People Against Regime Violence",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nI am reaching out as your constituent from {{RidingName}}, postal code {{PostalCode}}, regarding the horrific violence being inflicted on the Iranian people by their own government.\n\nWhat is happening in Iran is not a crackdown - it is a slaughter. The regime is shooting unarmed protesters with live ammunition. Young people with nothing but bare hands are facing military forces armed with real war bullets. To hide these crimes, the regime repeatedly shuts down the internet, plunging the country into darkness while it kills with impunity.\n\nThe world must not look away.\n\nCanada has long championed human rights on the world stage. I ask that you use your voice and influence to:\n\n- Condemn the regime's use of lethal force against civilians\n- Call for immediate restoration of internet access in Iran\n- Support Magnitsky sanctions against commanders ordering these killings\n- Engage with Iranian-Canadian communities on this issue\n- Back initiatives that support a democratic transition in Iran\n\nPrince Reza Pahlavi has been a beacon of hope for millions of Iranians. His consistent advocacy for secular democracy, non-violence, and human rights offers a path forward for Iran. He represents unity across all ethnic and religious groups in Iran, and his vision aligns perfectly with Canadian values. Canada should support this democratic movement.\n\nAs a resident of {{PostalCode}} in your riding, I urge you to stand with the Iranian people.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration."
