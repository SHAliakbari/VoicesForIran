  "Subject": "Canada must stand with Iran - urgent action requested",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nIranian-Canadian families in our community are grieving while the Islamic Republic escalates repression-mass killings, torture, executions, and internet blackouts to hide its crimes. In solidarity with Iran-s Lion-and-Sun Revolution and the people-s uprising for freedom, democracy, and human rights, I am asking for urgent, principled Canadian action. The regime is failing, yet it continues brutal violence; the era of freedom is near.\n\nI respectfully request the following actions:\n\n1. Dismantle the regime-s machinery of repression and protect the people of Iran.\n2. Cut off the regime-s financial lifelines in full.\n3. Ensure free internet and communications for the people of Iran.\n4. Expel the regime-s -diplomats- and prosecute its criminals.\n5. Immediate release of all political prisoners.\n6. Prepare to recognize a legitimate transitional government to lead Iran toward democracy.\n7. Publicly condemn the massacres and the IRGC-s role in repression, and enforce removals of senior IRGC members reported to be in Canada.\n8. Seize regime-linked assets for humanitarian relief and democratic opposition support, and formally invite Prince Reza Pahlavi to address Parliament.\n\nThank you for standing with the Iranian people and our community.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue for our community and for Canada.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
