  "Subject": "Urgent: Support Iran-s Lion-and-Sun Revolution - Canada must act now",
  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeFullName}},\n\nI am a concerned constituent living in {{PostalCode}} in your {{RidingOrRegion}}.\n\nI am writing in solidarity with Iran-s Lion-and-Sun Revolution and the Iranian people-s uprising for freedom, democracy, and human rights. The Islamic Republic continues brutal repression-mass killings of tens of thousands, torture, executions, and repeated internet blackouts meant to hide crimes. The regime is failing, yet it escalates violence; many Iranians believe the era of freedom is near.\n\nI respectfully ask you to act decisively and publicly. Please support these urgent actions:\n\n1. Dismantle the regime-s machinery of repression and protect the people of Iran.\n2. Cut off the regime-s financial lifelines in full.\n3. Ensure free internet and communications for the people of Iran.\n4. Expel the regime-s -diplomats- and prosecute its criminals.\n5. Immediate release of all political prisoners.\n6. Prepare to recognize a legitimate transitional government to lead Iran toward democracy.\n7. Publicly condemn the massacres and the IRGC-s role in repression, and enforce removals of senior IRGC members reported to be in Canada.\n8. Seize regime-linked assets for humanitarian relief and democratic opposition support, and formally invite Prince Reza Pahlavi to address Parliament.\n\nThank you for standing with the Iranian people at this critical moment.\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue for our community and for Canada.\n\nSincerely,\n{{UserName}}"
