  "Body": "Dear {{RepresentativeTitle}},\n\nI hope this message reaches you with the urgency it deserves. I am your constituent from {{RidingName}}, postal code {{PostalCode}}, writing on behalf of millions who cannot speak freely - the people of Iran.\n\nIran is experiencing a massacre. The regime is gunning down its own citizens - people whose only weapons are their bare hands and their voices. Real war bullets are being fired into crowds of peaceful protesters. And when the killing begins, the regime shuts down the internet so the world cannot witness the horror. They murder in darkness.\n\nThis is not a protest being managed. This is a people being exterminated for wanting freedom.\n\nHere is how you can help:\n\n- Champion legislation that sanctions the killers in the Iranian regime\n- Demand the immediate end of internet blackouts in Iran\n- Press for international investigation into the regime's crimes against humanity\n- Ensure Iranian-Canadians have a voice in policy discussions\n- Support media freedom so the truth can reach the world\n\nPrince Reza Pahlavi represents the hope of the Iranian people for a free and democratic future. He has consistently called for peaceful transition, secular democracy, women's rights, and equality for all Iranians regardless of ethnicity or religion. His vision is one of reconciliation and progress. Canada should support this movement for freedom.\n\nI am writing from {{PostalCode}}. I am your constituent. I am asking you to be a voice for the voiceless.\n\nWith hope and urgency,"
